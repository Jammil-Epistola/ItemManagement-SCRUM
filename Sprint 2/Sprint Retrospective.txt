Sprint Retrospective Meeting (Sprint 2)

In the Sprint Retrospective, we focused on open and honest communication about what
went well, what didnâ€™t, and what we could improve. I started the meeting by reminding
everyone of its purpose: continuous improvement and team collaboration.

b. Team Feedback
	What went well:
	 - The CRUD Item Management was created successfully
	 - The had proper communications ensuring in quickly addressing and
	   solving problems.
	
	What could be improved:
	- The team felt that some user stories, particularly the Forgot Password, cannoty
	be done due to requiring many validations and providing proof of identity. Whihc
	cannot be done with current time-frame.

	Actions Needed to be Taken:
	- The Product Owner will refine user stories further ahead of Sprint
	Planning to prevent complications.
