Sprint Retrospective

a. Sprint Restrospective Meeting in the Sprint Restrospective,
we focused on open and honest communication about what went well,
what didn't, and what we could improve.

b. Team. Feedback 

What went well: - FrontEnd of the website was made along with a Login
and Main Page - implemented a Search Functionality as a stated in user
Story 2.1

What could be improved:
- Lack of proper communication on most meetings. Mainly only few participated
in the chat
- No clear roles on  huge delays of what supposed to be a 2-week Sprint(finished in
like 2 and a half week for sprint 1)
- Test were done although no documentation

Actions Needed to be Taken:
- Give clear roles to each members and if no participation just ignore it and 
continue as participation will be based on github commit history
- Members should learn how to commit also create a branch and request pull to 
prevent a messy repository

Responsive Design Implemented: 
- Team members collaborated well in implementing key features, such as the user 
authentication system, despite the overall communication challenges.

Regular Code Reviews:
- The team conducted regular code reviews which helped to identify bugs early 
on, leading to smoother integration of different components.
