Sprint Retrospective

a. Sprint Restrospective Meeting in the Sprint Restrospective,
we focused on open and honest communication about what went well,
what didn't, and what we could improve.

b. Team. Feedback 
 
What went well: -FrontEnd of the website was made along with a Login
and Main Page - implemented a Search Functionality as a stated in user
Story 2.1

What could be improved:
- Lack of proper communication on most meetings. Mainly only few participated
in the chat
- No clear roles on  huge delays of what supposed to be a 2-week Sprint(finished in
like 2 and a half week for sprint 1)
- Test were done although no documentation

Actions Needed to be Taken:
- Give clear roles to each members and if no participation just ignore it and 
continue as participation will be based on github commit history
- Members should communicate clearly from the upcoming sprint
and do their part well.
- Team Members should be knowledgeable on how to use github by now and knows
how to commit
- Forgot Password functionality will be brought in Sprint 2 for
implementation
